##  Problem & Outcome

In **medical wearable devices**, data reliability during power interruptions is critical. Conventional **volatile memories** lose vital signs data when energy is interrupted.

**Outcome:**  
Development of a **secure, low-power Medical Event Logger SoC** using **ReRAM non-volatile memory** to ensure **data persistence and integrity** even during unexpected power failures.

##  Approach (Why NVM?) & What’s Novel

Unlike **Flash** or **SRAM**, **ReRAM NVM** provides **persistent storage** with:
- Ultra-low write energy  
- No standby power consumption  
- High endurance and retention  

Our design integrates **BM Labs ReRAM IP** within the **Caravel open-source SoC**, featuring a **custom Secure Logger Controller (FSM)** that manages:
- FIFO buffering  
- Fault detection  
- Secure event writes  

**Novelty:**  
> First open-source Caravel-based medical logger leveraging ReRAM for real-time fail-safe logging at the edge.
